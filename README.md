This project is a GetFly internship assignment, featuring a mobile application with two main pages: FAQ and Past Events. The app utilizes a drawer layout to navigate between these pages, accessible from the left drawer. The FAQ page provides answers to common questions, while the Past Events page lists previous events with details such as time, location, and description. The project is developed using Kotlin and Android Studio, leveraging modern Android development practices.
